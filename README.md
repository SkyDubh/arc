# Arduino Rotator Controlbox

[WIP] For the ATMega 2560

Dependencies:
Font:
SevenSegmentFull.c  (http://www.rinkydinkelectronics.com/r_fonts.php)
	The SevenSegmentFull font is used to print on screen a better view of 
	degrees setting and the azimuth of antenna beam direction.
	
Libraries:
UTFT.h (http://www.rinkydinkelectronics.com/library.php)
UTFT_Geometry.h (http://www.rinkydinkelectronics.com/library.php)
	The UTFT is a universal library that supports a large number of display 
	modules and controllers, so it will be much easier to keep the project 
	up-to-date in the future.
	UTFT_Geometry library adds some geometric functions to UTFT library.
