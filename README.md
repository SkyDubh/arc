# Arduino Rotator Controlbox

## Library dependencies

UTFT.h (http://www.rinkydinkelectronics.com/library.php)

UTFT_Geometry.h (http://www.rinkydinkelectronics.com/library.php)

The UTFT is a universal library that supports a large number of display modules and controllers, so it will be much easier to keep the project up-to-date in the future. UTFT_Geometry adds some geometric functions to UTFT library.

Both need to be installed in your Arduino compiler library directory.

## Compilation

In order to compile and install this project, you need to edit the configuration file (**Settings.h**). You can find a sample configuration provided with the project (**Settings_sample.h**).

It is still a WIP and currently developed and tested on an **ATMega 2560** only.
